# WS09: File IO - scores to grades

Write a program, called process_marks, which takes a filename as a command line argument. This file should contain pairs of name & score on each line (separated by a tab) as seen in the example below:
```
$ cat inputfile 
Robert 88 
Alexia 77 
Jimmy 55 
Sandro 66 
Frida 99
```

The program should read the input file line by line and produce a CSV file in the format:

```name,score,grade```

The grades are to be distributed as shown below:  
```
0..49   F  
50..64  C  
65..74  B  
75..89  A  
90..100 A+
```
Error messages should be displayed if opening the input or output files fails or if command line argument is missing. A sample output is shown below:
```
$ ./process_marks inputfile 
Processing rows ..... 
Finished all file, results in outputfile.csv

$ cat outputfile.csv 
Robert,88,A 
Alexia,77,A 
Jimmy,55,C 
Sandro,66,B 
Frida,99,A+
```
## Additional task
Pprovide a way to show progress taking place, for example printing a full stop character for each line processed.
